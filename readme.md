# Geoscream

Geoscream is a project that was created for the [2019 IBM Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/).  The intention is to provide a passive dashboard for people interested in data feeds that contain geolocation data.  It's initial purpose is best described by imagining an earthquake in a city.  The inhabitants of the city will likely use the social media platforms they already use day-to-day to post information and updates.  If you imagine that this is all on a platform such as Twitter, you can imagine that you can subscribe to specific hashtags in specific regions to identify in real time opportunities to help or to understand passively the activity happening in the region.
